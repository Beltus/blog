## This article is about letting students know what they can be doing while waiting for their break.


The entire internet is swamped with scholarships like bees in a hive. Every year thousands of scholarships get announced by different countries and organizations around the globe. You definitely are going to be eligible to apply for some and others are not going to be of any interest to you. applying for these scholarships is often seen by most students as a daunting task especially those who are still beginning to learn the ropes. For new beginners just entering the pursuit for an opportunity to study abroad here is a [link](https://beltus.github.io/vision/blog/breaking-process/) to help you understand the different types of scholarships and get your foot into the game as soon as possible.

The objective of this article is to let the prospective scholar understand that applying for scholarships does not mean you have been accepted.
In this article I share my thoughts on what students who are passionate and self-driven to fight for their dreams of having the best quality of education abroad should be doing during and after the periods of applications. This will definitely help you not only to evade falling into the delusional thought process of believing applying means *undoubtedly* acceptance, but provide you with some fresh ideas of what you should do to continuously increase your odds of getting accepted.

Without taking much of your time, here are the 5 things every student should engage in while applying or waiting for acceptance for any scholarship.


## 1. Keep building your skills.
There is a huge pitfall that thousands of students fall into after finishing any level of education for example undergraduate studies. They **Stop Learning!!**
Graduation feels like a get out of jail free card into the free world. No home works, no writing of papers, no exams. Doesn't that just feel relieving. Well for now it does.
Scholarships are tricky with no guarantee of success on the first try after graduation. So folding your arms and chilling while expecting for a positive response from the application is not the smart move to make. Think of scholarships like a **Game of Chance** but not literally. While you are on the course of hunting for scholarships never stop developing new skills and honing old ones. Enroll on free massive online open courses that provide free quality video lessons in diverse fields. Some popular online platforms include **Coursera, Udemy, Udacity**. This will keep your brain sharp and agile. Always think of your brain as a body muscle that slowly becomes smaller and weaker when you stop exercising it.

## 2. Spend time building your CV and Motivation letter

How I wish I could compose a song about this part and sing to the ears of every graduate seeking for future opportunities - jobs, scholarships just to give you a clue of the degree of importance of building a standard presentable and captivating CV. I felt prey to this for a long time and the repercussions were colossal. Never stop working on your CV or motivation letter. Write, edit, write, edit etc. For example, having a bad motivation letter is like a football player coming to the pitch with jeans ready to play a match. Take as much time as you need to build convincing motivation letter for yourself that is versatile. Check out this link that describes how to develop a engaging motivation letter.

## 3. Engage is Social Activities
I cant emphasize this much. I know how boring social activities like group meetings might sound, believe me I have been there and I regretted it.
One secret I uncovered in the selection criterion of scholarships is the ability of the student to interact and participate actively in a culturally diverse environment.
Notice, that most scholarship wont explicitly spell this out on their site, however, a student that has been contributing in certain outdoor social activities in their locality has a
greater chance of winning a scholarship. My attitude towards social gatherings is very positive as I personally love meeting new people, listening to their stories, their countries and cultural differences which are always on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to ours in Africa.


## 4. Get your things together
When you work smart you work smooth.

Scholarships are all about filling information on a form and hitting the submit button. Easy right?
No!! What you are going to fill if you have the information?
95% of the reasons of incomplete scholarship forms is lack of some vital key information by the students. The most common of which are passports, health certificates, reference letters among others.

Let's imagine for example you just won your dream scholarship today and have to be in that country in a month's time. By some unforseen circumstance you miss this golden once in a life-time opportunity just because you could not get your passport in time. You are going to be freaking disappointed in yourself. I come from Cameroon in Africa (just in case you don't know where Cameroon is located :) ) and I know how long it takes to get a passport. I almost felt victim to this incident.

Having these documents handy makes your life so much easier and the application process so much simpler. It's like having your bag-pack ready and loaded to go whenever called upon.


## 5. Rejection Doesn't mean You aint good enough.

Writing about this evokes funny memories of how many rejections me and some close friends of mine got when we all decided to pursue higher education in different countries. At the beginning, when you spend hours writing motivation letters, research plans, essays just to wake up early one morning to an email saying _Thank you for your interest in blah blah blah scholarship, however we are sorry to inform you that due to the thousands of applications we received this year and the limited number of places, we will not be going further with your application_. It can be really gut-wrenching and demotivating forcing you to want to just give up and quit.

Here is the secret **Don't take it personally**. Take it with a grain of salt. Remember, rejection doesn't mean you are not good enough. After we received loads of rejections we started laughing whenever a rejection mail came it. We got use to it while maintaining the positive attitude and discipline of continuous applications until we got it.

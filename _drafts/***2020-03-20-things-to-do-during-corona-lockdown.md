Write about what people should be doing during corona lockdown.


We find ourselves in the state of a world wide pandemic that no one anticipated. The word COVID-19 is more viral than the virus itself. It is a buzz word that is causing hysteria in the minds of most people. Schools are shutdown, international events postponed, flights grounded and the list continues. Almost everyone is on lockdown working from home. There are two ways you can choose to view this period, either as an opportunity or a challenge. Its all up to you. Your choice doesn't change the current situation of COVID-19 but it changes how you are going to emerge after the crisis. Its either you emerge smarter and stronger or you emerge dumber and weaker.

In this article, I am going try to draw your attention to some things you should be conscious about so that you can make the best out of this period in order to emerge as a hero. There is silverlining to every dark cloud. We are in a dark cloud, can you see the silver lining? If you can't let me try to point it out to you in the next few sentences.

## Develop a New skill.
There is one thing I know COVID-19 has given most of us, that  is TIME. If you are a procastinator like me, you will know that the excuse we always give ourselves for not doing anything is there aint time. Now what are going to tell yourself? This is the perfect opportunity to get up and try out something new. Something you had always to do but didnt have time. Maybe you wanted to learn  how to sing, how to dance, play a musical instrument, how to write code, how to create website, etc. Whatever it is, now is the ideal moment to make use of this unexpected break because this might be the last time we ever get such a scenario in our life time on planet earth. A very good friend of mine, just launched his new youtube channel a few days ago and I subscribed instantly. That is something he had been talking about ever since I met him last year, then he saw this window of opportunity and just couldnt miss it. That is how the smart thinkers operate and I know you too are one.


## Recline from News
Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, we cannot take our eyes off our phones. Our phones buzzing like bees in a hive with news updates from numerous sources. Everyone wants to know what is the latest, what is happening out there right now. This has even led to global panic and hysterical behaviour in some communities. Just think for a second, what have you benefited from the news until now? As non-medical personels there is nothing we can do to cure the corona virus. We can only stay at home and wash our hands. Thats it.  Don't get addicted to the news because the news have been designed to keep its viewers glued to their screens. Your blood pressure we rise just from listening to the news and this can be extremely detrimental. Be smart enough to focus and not loose your mind in this chaos. I don't even watch the news anymore because at the end of the day, my friends must have watched enough to feed me with the updates in just 30 minutes. The news channels are booming at the moment, making millions of dollars from the outbreak while you sit at home panicking. Watch online videos of some courses or movies.




## Sports

Now is the time to create and maintain some really good habits. One of the most important habits of all is sports. It doesnt matter wether you love doing sports or not. The question is, how much do you love yourself? The human body is not designed to be confined on one spot. We are literally under house imprisonment. It is going to be easy to wake up in the morning have breakfast, go back to bed watch movies, chat with friends, visit the fridge every 10 minutes. This seems like the perfect life, isn't it? well No!! Let's imagine you do this for a month on lock down. How many pounds are you going to gain? You do not need a gym to do sports. Stop making excuses. All you need, is an empty space and there you go. Staying healthy during this period is not going to be easy but it is imperative that you try as hard as you can. After this crisis, you can either resume school or work strong and fit or fat and fluffy.

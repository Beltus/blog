## When Corona met Ebola.

I had to do some in-depth thought before sharing this story with my readers.

So it was thursday in the evening I just got home from school and decided to give my friend a call. It's been 6 months since we last saw each other however we live just 15mins away. I didnt know till after we spoke on phone and agreed to meet at starbucks for a cup of coffee and catching up.

So fast forward to starbucks the next day. We ordered a cheese cake, I got sicak chicolata she got capocino. We sat down chatting about whats going on in each other life. School and lectures and friends. In a moment of silent she mentioned corona which to be sincere i didnt wanna bring up because i had a hunch she must have been having a hard time since the outbreak. Here is why?

My friend Z is from Kazakistan so she has looks similar to chinese. Lots of people just assume she is chinese. After the corona virus outbreak things got really rough with her and her friends in Istanbul.

Getting back to our chat in starbucks, she recounted a short incident at the hospital when she went for her normal checkup. With skepticism written on her fore head the nurse asked her where is from.
 "Kazakistan" she replied. "How long have you been here?" nurse asked her with  suspicious eyes. "few months" she replied with irritation. With hesitation or further questioning she slowly pulled out a mask from under her table and put in on right in front of her face. She was petrified by the reaction.

 She went ahead to tell me how she cant even sneeze in a metro or bus when she gets the urge,  for fear of causing a panic or total isolation. Think about it for a second, Have you ever tried to hold down a sneeze? Well, I can't.

 As she narrated her ordeal, I coould understand perfectly what she was going through and I told her, welcome to the side of the minority.

 As we rounded up our drinks and scintillating conversation, she remembered she had to activate her internet package, so I decided to accompany her to the shop. As we walked out of Starbuck into the open I had this epiphany.
 I suddenly told her *Ebola meets Corona*. She burst into hysterical laughter. As we walked into the gigantic mall, I was thinking.. **how deadly can we both be at this moment**.  I'm black by the way, if you didnt get the joke.

 How I wish people could stop making the lives of others miserable. Stop being stereotypes and treat every as a human. Difference in skin colour and race should be a thing of beauty and pride not the hallmark of discrimination.

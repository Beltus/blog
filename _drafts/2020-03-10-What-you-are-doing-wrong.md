## Title: What is wrong with my scholarship applications

Write about some of the mistakes students make in their scholarship applications that are unknown to them and they never find out.

## 1. Boring Motivation Letter.

I read something from the NewYork 21 times best seller and prolific writer Jerry Jenkins. He said
> If your writing is boring to you then your reader is sleeping.

This is a powerful phrase that transformed how I personally approach problems in diverse domain. The fundamental essence of a motivation letter is to **Motivate** the reader. Never forget that. You might have been pondering and brooding over the reasons why you aint getting any offers from scholarships and one major part of the problem all this while could be your letter.
When you sit down and start punching in those words character by character, don't loose sight of the primary objective - to motivate. You got a unique talent and story different from the thousands of applicants out there. How you tell that story is what sets you apart from the rest of the people. Strive to captivate whoever picks up your letter to read in such a way that, they wont want to stop reading till the very end. Hundreds of candidates write generic motivation letters that bores the hell out of their reader. Leave an impression in the mind of your reader. What makes me stand out form the crowd? what is your story?

I came across this technique of writing an enthralling motivation letter by starting with what is called a **hook**. A hook is simply a unique scintillating personal story to keep your reader glued and eager to read further into your application.

Lets take for example this a hook of a motivation letters
> When Flight 1549 touched down into the cold, dark waters of the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, as a passenger, I thought my life was over.

Now you tell me. Do you want to continue reading this letter or not? Be honest.It feels like this candidate just dropped a bomb. Search deep within for a personal story which relates to the reason you are applying for that position and start with that. It changes everything.

Remember, if your motivation letter is boring to you, then your reader already dropped your application.

## 2. Incomplete Application.


## 3. Not Enough applications.


In this [article](https://beltus.github.io/vision/blog/quadruple-chances/) I mentioned one of the secrets of quadrupling your chances of landing your dream scholarship is to apply to as many scholarships as possible. The internet has become a omnipresent entity that even my granny back in my village Kumbo is connected to 24/7. This means the number of scholarship seekers has exponentially grown over the past few years. The bad news is that, this has reduced the probability of landing one. Scholarship applications has become more or less a game of gamble. The only way to increase your odds is to place many bets. Do not get complacent and comfortable after applying for just a few scholarships out there. My first year when I decided t hunt for scholarship, I fell into this complacency pithole and literally wasted an entire academic year of my life. Fortunately  I learnt from my mistakes and the following year I was ready. I went all and applied for every opportunity i was eligible for. I still got rejected but behold, I finally landed a fully funded masters scholarship in one of Turkey's most prestigious universities. Please do not make same mistake. The scholarship is a war-zone where only the toughest get to succeed. Do not get lazy and do not take chances. That scholarship you did not apply for might just be your dream flying far into the horizon.

## 4. Errors in Applications.

How seriously do you take scholarship applications? If you are a passerby just trying out his luck like a lottery game then this aint for you. You can not afford to make any mistakes when the competition is high  and the stakes are also high. Think about it. A scholarship such as the [turkish government scholarship](link to site) recieves over 16000 applications from over 120 different countries. They accept about 5000 scholars yearly. How many applications do you think will be completely error free?

Spend some time proofreading every sentence you type in an application and I will recommend using applications like [grammmarly](lin) to help you quickly spot those little tiny devils hiding within your perfectly written application.

Next time when you sit down to apply for any scholarship, I want you to remember that, that typo you made and didnt pay attention to is the reason you might loose your oppoortunity and the hours you put in to apply might just flushed down the toilet.

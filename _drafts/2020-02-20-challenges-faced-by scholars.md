# Title: Overcoming Challenges that scholarships students face abroad.

As a fresh undergraduate from the University of Buea in Cameroon, my passion and excitement to pursue  higher education in a more developed country blinded me
from visualizing some of the growling challenges I was going to face. As a result, I was not psychologically prepared to tackle these challenges headon. This could have safe me lots of downtime
I wish I knew back then what i know now. I had no modicum of a clue what I was about to encounter and so was the many other scholars I met when I arrived.

As I started interacting with most students from the other parts of the world I began to realize we all were facing very similar problems. So I decided to
write this article for any lucky student out there who reads to be prepared to face these challenges rather than surprised by them. In this article I am going some of the secrets I have used to overcome most of these problems and get my feet in the ground.

So without much I do, lets start with the most common problem.

## Depression is almost inevitable

Trust me this is one of the things I can say with absolute certainty you are going to go through. Right now you must be thinking. Not me Beltus, Not me!!.
Hell yes!! You. I was ignorant just like until I got hit as well. So did almost every scholar I met. Everyone I talked you had a period that they struggled with depression. For some it was longer than others. I remember this particular afternoon that we were having lectures and this young lady from Sudan suddenly burst into tears and took the class by surprise. We were all puzzled and confused by what could have cost such an outburst. I feared she may have recieved bad news from home via text. It was later we learnt she had been struggling with depression. This is just one incident out of the hundreds I had heard including my own.

What makes this even a bigger problem especially for African scholars is that, as Africans we have been made to believe that depression is something for the white guys as a results when it hits us we remain in denial for a long time fighting an unnecessary hard battle within ourselves.

There is lots of things that will trigger depression some of which include, missing your family for very long, new environment, no close trusted friends, no favorite food offered, adapting to new educational system etc.

Despite all these problems, here is what I want every student to understand. First know that this might hit, but be prepared to take the hit so that you suffer less damage. First of all, make very calls with your love ones back home to maintain the bond and reduce the degree at which you miss them. Make new friends especially those in same condition like you. Talk to them about what you going through. As you share you will be surprised by how much you guys are gonna have in common.
Dont stay indoors. Go out into the city even if you have no one to go with and stroll, watch the people in the park, watch the kids play and follow each other, enjoy the music from the guitar of the random street guitarist and then head home with a refreshed and invigorated mind.

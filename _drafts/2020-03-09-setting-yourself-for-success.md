## Title : Setting your self for success as a Student.


## Introduction

Have you ever pondered just for a second why there are some students in your class who seem to ace every single exams? No matter how tough a course or subject is they somehow know how to figure things out so effortlessly sometimes it can be irritating expecially when you are having a tough time at the other end of the class. Yeah!! I guess we all have had such "genuises" who made use even think we are not smart enough. We start feeling dumb, intimidated and not belonging. Here is something for you

"Genuises are not born they are made"

In this article I will like to reach out to all those students who feel they are not intelligent enough, smart enough to pursue a career in some respectable and seemingly esoteric fields. You know what i am talking about. Engineering, Astronomy, medicine etc. Before I dive into indepth into this article I want to say **Stop telling yourself the lies today".  I will share some of the techniques high performing students use that makes them guru-like figures in the eyes of the others.

## Things you need to start doing to become a genuis

## 1. Learn how to Learn

The phrase learning how to learn might sound ludicrous but believe me this is the key that opens the doors to the world of limitless acquisition of knowledge. If there is one thing I will tell you today as a student trying to create your path through the forest of life to success, is to **learn how to learn**. I am grateful to my elder sister who taught me how to study mathematics in my sophomore year in middle schools after a series of incessant failures.  I transformed from being an average student in mathematics to becoming the top student from that moment. You should note that, every subject you will come across has a unique technique that warrants its studying for which if applied will gaurantee total understanding and inevitable success. Let's imagine for a second, you have an exam in mathematics and you spent the entire week reading your book like a fiction novel. Guess what is going to happen in the exams.

The challenge here becomes **How to find the correct technique to study each course?** unfortunately there isnt a single formula to do as it all depends on the course. However, here are some the tips you can apply
> If the course includes mathematical equations you should lots of examples
> If its only text, like literature, get a highlighter and underline important phrases
>Programming will definitely require that you practice on writing more codes.
> Designing etc

## 2. Listen Before talking

## 3. Who you hanging out with?

Intelligence is contagious




## 4. Discipline
> You level of success is determined by your level of discipline and perseverance

> Without discipline success is impossible ~ Lou Holtz

I believe with discipline all life battles can be won. I have spent a lot time with students from different and different level from undergraduate, masters through to Phd. These students I consider are top in their various classes and disciplines and one thing I realised amid them all is discipline. They know exactly when to hang out and have fun. When to work on their projects, when to study. One could say this is inherent in their nature, but this is something they had developed over the years such that it is second nature to them. This single habit of discipline is just the wall that stands in the way of you becoming a "genuis" too. One thing I know is how hard it is to discipline ourselves. Sometimes it feels like you are 2 people in one body. One says lets go party while the other says **you need to study**. Being discipline means being able to control both people in your mind and do what needs to be done whether you like it or not.

It is easy to develop this skill, so start with little baby steps. For example, make your bed every morning immediately you make up. Great start don't you think? From there decided to read 5 pages of a book before going to bed and work your way up. The idea is to be consistent and don't get discouraged.


## 5. Take More Frequent Breaks.

If there is one thing I learned the hard way, is the significant benefit of constant breaks during study period. If you are a midnight candle burner, how is working out for you till now?
There is a huge paradox that the more you study without rest the less you tend to know.Despite the fact that our  brains are made up of 90% water, I want you to visualize your brain as a tough round muscle. Just like muscles of the arms and legs. The more you exercise them the tougher and bigger they become.However, excessive muscle exercise results in muscle tear and potential damage which can be lethal. The "geniuses" around you have mastered how to exercise their brains and how to rest them. The know exactly when to rest and then continue studying in an efficiently stress free way.

Do not work your brains like an oxen ploughing a farm if you want to become a top performing student. In fact you are serving a lot of time by taking lots of breaks which can seem paradoxical. By doing this you are giving your brain the time to digest the food and assimilate it.

Next time when you sit to study for 2 hours. Study for 25minutes called a pomodoro and then take a 5minutes break, then another pomodoro then a break until the 2 hrs is over. You eill be mindblown by the results.


## 6. Read from multiple sources.

Thank God for the internet and especially youtube. If you are a student who only listens to what your professor says in lectures, then you better wake the hell up. You know why? most professors suck at explaining complex concepts in a simple understandable way. Top students sometimes sit in class as a formality to satisfy attendance requirements although they still give their undivided attention to the professors. immediately they get home they turn on their computers and search for more more lucid and explicit explanation of same concepts. Their understanding of a such a concept just quadrupled. While you might be struggling home going through the lecture slides and getting more confused, they are done. Fast and agile.

Start complementing your lectures with internet content to cement any complex concepts in your brain. No matter how perplexing a lecture or concept might be, there is a guy online who can chew it to its tiniest bits ready for you to swallow. You just need to take 5 minutes of your time and find the guy.

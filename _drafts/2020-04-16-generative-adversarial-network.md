Generative AI
Generative AI has been described as one of the most promising advances in AI in the past decade by the MIT Technology Review.

Generative AI opens the door to an entire world of creative possibilities with practical applications emerging across industries, from turning sketches into images for accelerated product development, to improving computer-aided design of complex objects.

For example, Glidewell Dental is training a generative adversarial network adept at constructing detailed 3D models from images. One network generates images and the second inspects those images. This results in an image that has even more anatomical detail than the original teeth they are replacing.

Generative AI enables computers to learn the underlying pattern associated with a provided input (image, music, or text), and then they can use that input to generate new content. Examples of Generative AI techniques include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders, and Transformers.


What are GANs?
GANs, a generative AI technique, pit 2 networks against each other to generate new content. The algorithm consists of two competing networks: a generator and a discriminator.

A generator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to create new data resembling the source data it was trained on.

The discriminator is another convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to differentiate between real and synthetic data.

The generator and the discriminator are trained in alternating cycles such that the generator learns to produce more and more realistic data while the discriminator iteratively gets better at learning to differentiate real data from the newly created data.

Number of epochs
When the training loop has passed through the entire training dataset once, we call that one epoch. Training for a higher number of epochs will mean your model will take longer to complete its training task, but it may produce better output if it has not yet converged. You will learn how to determine when a model has completed most of its training in the next section.

Learning Rate
The learning rate controls how rapidly the weights and biases of each network are updated during training. A higher learning rate might allow the network to explore a wider set of model weights, but might pass over more optimal weights.

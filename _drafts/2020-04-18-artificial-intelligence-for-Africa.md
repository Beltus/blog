## Objective of this Article. Advice Africans of the Effects of not Learning about AI.

AI is the new electricity as Prof. Andrew Ng  of Stanford University audaciously put it and this is an undisputed fact.

During my master's degree studies in Europe, I had an ephiphany. I asked myself, what are Africans contributing to help develop the continent
technologically. I decided to research on one of the world's beiggest social media Facebook, to find out if there existed any group on
subjects like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. To my unfathomable surprise, I could only find one group.
Artificial intelligence for South Africans.

This was mind-boggling because the second largest continent has remained a consumer in every domain for as long as i can possibly envision.

We import food, equipments, labor, experts and pay huge sums of money.

As I inundated myself deeper and deeper into AI, I realized how easy Africans could use AI to drive development in the continent.
The reason for this is simple. Unlike other sectors such as manufacturing that requires a colossal amount of importation of equipment,
AI simply needs a brain and a computer and that we got. Why cant we exploit that.

It saddens my heart to say this. At the mention of AI, most of my brothers and sisters shiver in fright. The word AI to them means robots moving and
doing complex stuff in an advanced European Lab run by the highest echelon of scientists. As ludicrous as this might sound, I totally understand cause
i had such mindset many years ago.

Africans do not have a modicum of a clue, how much AI is already influencing their lives. How much products that are powered by AI they are using to perform their day to
day activities. To be ignorant is to sell your soul to the devil you dont even know. Huge companies use AI, for racial profiling and targeting consumers and unfortunately my fellow
brothers browsing the internet are oblivious of this.

You look a dress on Amazon, later on when you turn on facebook, an advert suddenly pops up showing you similar cloths. You smile and can probably thank
the Gods for sending such a sign from heaven. And there you go. Click and buy. What just happened? AI just happened, simple as that.

As we were gullible during the times of colonisation, we are exactly as gullible now during the time of AI. I dont want history to repeat itself and our children and
grand children and their children spend the next 2 centuries trying to clean up our mess and fix things as we are still struggling to correct the mistakes
our grandfathers made during colonisation.

Our leaders are old with no idea of what technology is or what can be done with it. This makes them highly susceptible to accept ridiculous offers placed
at their tables by the super powers with no indepth metric of proper evaluation of the present and future ramifications.

They are as ignorant now with respect to technology as our great grand fathers were during the period of colonialism. This is indeed modern colonialism.

At Istanbul Technical University, one of the most prestigious technological universities, I had the opportunity to learn about AI algorithms and implement
some interesting projects related to AI. At this point, I suddenly came to realize that, most of what we think about the intricacies of AI is bogus.

Infact, it is time for Africa to re-model their educational system and focus on relevant disciplines which are evitably the future. We need to train
our youths in computer vision , machine learning and deeplearning and let them use such knowledge to change the continent.

It is sad that, we allow people from the European countries to come to our continent, identify the problems we have for us. The problems we can clearly see, propose
solutions and sign contracts of millions of dollars. The same money which could be invested in training experts who will remain forever a powerful human resource
for the country and intend will use their experience and expertise to further teach more youths.


Here is an example of a project, face recognition system in a minsitering could be bought by a government for millions, whereby this project could be
implemented in a day maximum.

It is time Africans especially our youths, begin to change their mindsets about AI. Try as much as possible to have clue of what it does and never get carried away.


I connected with this guy MaelFabien on LinkedIn after seeing his blog and what he has done so far in AI especially in the domain NLP. This guy left France to
come offer lectures in Senegal to youths on AI. I was impressed by his effort in making a change one person and a time. So, I told him I was interested in writing articles related to AI and needed some ideas from him. He said something that stopped me in my tracks. He said "you can write articles on the applications of AI in Africa"

Up to this moment in time, I had never thought about how AI could be used in very continent where I was coming from. It was absolutely a mind-changer to me.
How could I have missed this? Why I am even studying computer science if I can't make a difference in my home country. My mind went crazy and almost short-circuited.I started
thinking about ways I could possibly use AI and make a change one step at a time.  What are the applications that could be electrified by AI which could help
my grand mother better her well-being.

For weeks I thought about it, it was not easy because spending alot time out of the country slowly erases the memories of the challenges you use to face. So I had to
some meditation, trying to visualize myself at home and figuring out what can be done with AI to make an impact.

Some ideas that came to mind were related to agriculture where a farmer could use computer vision techniques to automatically group produce of different sizes.
Others included [think about more project ideas]

I'm just one guy, but Imagine for a second, if we could empower our youths with such knowledge and allow them to think freely? The transformation in the continent will be
humongous. The awesome thing about it is that, we don't even need some complex heavy machineries to get things started. All we need at this moment is mindset change towards
AI and its related fields, a computer and a few experts in the field of AI. If we can't manage to get the experts to the continent, no problems. Then all we need is
constant internet supply which is relatively cheaper in my opinion.

There are extraordinary online courses on AI flooding the internet these days that are highly effective and if not better than you can even learn in a classroom.
See, the advent of COVID_19 changed the course of things for life especially the mentality that quality education could only be achieve by sitting in
some boring class for hours listening to someone speak in to your ears. How wrong was that?

I believe the time is now for Africa to wake up from their slumber and become players in a game they had been spectators in way long before I was an idea in my dad's
mind. Either we become proactive and get on board or we get pushed under the bus and trampled on. This change can only happen with if the youths
are given the opportunity to make decisions and effect change. Some African countries have already taken a bold step towards shifting power to the youths such as
Namibia that appointed the youngest minister who is also a lady of age 23 in the history of the continent. Not forgetting Rwanda which is now a model and beckon of hope
for a better Africa.

We did succeed to break from the chains of slavery but we are still far from breaking from the chains of mental slavery and until we do, we remain at the
mercy of the superpowers. I'm not a politician, just a boy from a small village in Cameroon who has come this far and seen to much to shutup.

I pray and sincerely hope that, african youths will take the effort to contribute and determine how to shape their future and not allow it to continuously be determined by
others.

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a thing for the future, it is right here at our doorsteps we better welcome it and see how it can be used to better our lives
or allow others to use it for their financial gains at our own demise.


My name is Beltus Nkwawir and I'm just a guy trying to help my continent one step at a time

## Talk about the various opportunities that slip past your way.
## Things  I wish I knew when I was in Undergraduate for Today's Youths
## Shortsightedness
Think beyond your degree. Think 5years ahead anh nothing will surprise you.

## Connect with people More
Your success is in the hands of others. Your network determines your networth. Here is another one for you. If you want to get a job faster connect with people in a classes ahead of you.

## Stop thinking you are not good enough to be a scholar. ## Dont sell yourself short
 This has killed more dreams than the coronavirus has killed people. Opportunities come up and you see the number to be selected then you just give up.

## Focus on the Price.
 the words of my aunt who is a prof at Penn state still rings in my ears as if she is whispering into them at this very moment.

 ##Get your travel documents set and loaded for travel.

 ##  Take more opportunities to attend events and conferences. I cannot stress this enough. I only got involved with extra-curriculars when I was in my third year of University and wish I had started earlier. Participating in outside of the classroom learning will help you build a network, make connections, and learn more about yourself.

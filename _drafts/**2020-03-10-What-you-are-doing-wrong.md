How does it feel when you receive a rejection email from the scholarship of your dream? The hours you spent on crafting a motivation letter, the days it took to come up with 2500 words convincing them why you are the perfect candidate. Not ignoring how long it took to come up with a research proposal.

It feels like you have been stabbed in the heart with a dagger. It penetrates every fiber of the muscles. The most frustrating and annoying thing about it is that you are never given a subjective and customized reason why you weren't selected. It is always a polite **thank you letter**.

What if I can tell you there is something you could to not only increase your chances of getting selected but also avoid many of the pitfalls many applicants fall into when applying for scholarships?

I am not claiming I'm an expert or that if you do the things I outline here you will be guaranteed 100% to get the scholarship of your dreams. But as someone who made so many silly mistakes in his applications in the past and had to learn from a painful experience which finally led him to have his dream scholarship, I am here to help you avoid those mistakes.

In today's article, I will point out the mistakes you are making in your scholarship applications that probably result in your disqualification before it ever reaches the scholarship board.

## 1. Motivation Letter.

**How motivating is your motivation letter?**

I read something from the 21 times New York best-selling author and prolific writer Jerry Jenkins. He said
> If your writing is boring to you then your reader is sleeping.

This is a powerful phrase that transformed how I personally approach problems in diverse domains. The fundamental essence of a motivation letter is to **Motivate** the reader. Never forget that.

You might have been pondering and brooding over the reasons why you ain't getting any offers from scholarships and one major part of the problem all this while could be your letter.

When you sit down staring at your screen and start punching in those words character by character, don't lose sight of the primary objective - **to motivate**. You got a unique talent and unique story different from the thousands of applicants out there. How you tell that story is what sets you apart from the crowd.

Strive to captivate whoever picks up your letter to read in such a way that, they won't want to stop reading till the very end.  Hundreds of thousands of candidates write generic motivation letters that bore the hell out of their readers. Do not fall into this group. Be the black sheep in a flock of white sheep. Leave an impression in the mind of your reader.

These questions will help you to reshape how you write your next motivation letter. What makes you different from all the other applicants? what is your story? Your motivation is your story. Your story is your experience. Your experience is what makes you unique from the rest of the world.

Humans remember stories, not statistics, so begin your motivation letter with your story and write to impressed, enthrall and captivate the reader just like fiction writers do.

Remember, if your motivation letter is boring to you, then your reader already dropped your application.


here is an example image of a motivation letter.

I came across this technique of writing an enthralling motivation letter by starting with what is called a **hook**. A hook is simply a unique scintillating personal story to keep your reader glued and eager to read further into your application.

Lets take for example this a hook of a motivation letters
> When Flight 1549 touched down into the cold, dark waters of the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, as a passenger, I thought my life was over.

Now you tell me. Do you want to continue reading this letter or not? Be honest. It feels like this candidate just dropped a bomb. Search deep within for a personal story which relates to the reason you are applying for that position and start with that. It changes everything.

Remember, if your motivation letter is boring to you, then your reader already dropped your application.

## 2. Incomplete Application.

A scholarship application is a war zone. The competition is fierce. The slightest mistake and you are eliminated. You got to understand this. That is how serious you got to take it, if you want to win the battle.

If you have been ignoring to fill out some fields in the scholarship application forms? Next time, think again before taking such chances because 10.000 or more students will not.

In this **era of artificial intelligence**, everything is being automated including the initial elimination phase. Algorithms exist that help to cut down the number of applicants and an incomplete application is the perfect criterion for elimination. For any application that you fill, ensure to take some time out and complete the process.

Give yourself the opportunity it deserves and you will be proud. Don't take chances.


## 3. Not Enough applications.


In one of my previous [articles](https://beltus.github.io/vision/blog/quadruple-chances/) I mentioned one of the secrets of quadrupling your chances of landing your dream scholarship is to apply to as many scholarships as possible. This may sound like a lot of work but it comes down chances.

Think of getting a scholarship like you are in a casino in Las Vegas where you are throwing dice and you win only if you throw a double-six. If you keep throwing, there is a high probability you are eventually going to get a double-six. Simple as that.

The internet has become an omnipresent entity that even my granny back in my village Kumbo is online 24/7. This means the number of scholarship seekers has exponentially grown over the past few years. The bad news is that this has reduced the probability of being awarded one. Do not get complacent and comfortable after applying for just a few scholarships out there.

The first year when I decided to hunt for scholarships, I fell into this complacency pit hole after applying for 5 scholarships. Guess what? I wasted an entire academic year of my life. Fortunately,  I learned from my mistakes and the following year I was ready. I went in with all I got and applied for every opportunity I was eligible for. I still got rejected but behold, I finally landed a fully-funded master's scholarship in one of Turkey's most prestigious universities.

Please do not make the same mistake. A scholarship application is a battle-field where only the toughest get to succeed. Do not relent your efforts and do not take chances. That scholarship you did not apply for might just be your dream flying far into the horizon.

## 4. Errors in Applications.

How seriously do you take scholarship applications? If you are a passerby just trying out your luck like a lottery ticket then this ain't for you. You can not afford to make any mistakes when the competition is tight  and the stakes are also high.

Think about it. A scholarship organization such as the [turkish government scholarship](https://turkiyeburslari.gov.tr/) receives over 16000 applications from over 120 different countries around the globe. They accept about 5000 scholars yearly. How many applications do you think will be completely error free?

Spend some time proofreading every sentence you type in an application. I will recommend using applications like [grammmarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to help you quickly spot those little tiny devils hiding within your perfectly written application.

Next time when you sit down to apply for any scholarship, I want you to remember that every **typo** you make counts and can result in a colossal loss of your golden opportunity. Do not let the hours you put in to apply get flushed down the toilet because of a silly typo or incorrect grammar.


## The Takeaway

In this article, I have pointed out some of the things that most applicants of scholarships overlook during a scholarship application process. These often result in rejections of the candidates from the various scholarship boards. By paying a close eye on these details, you will avoid unnecessary rejections and increase your chances of landing your dream scholarship.


Good luck and never give up on your dreams until you ain't breathing. Every rejection email you receive should be a sign you are one step closer to accomplishing your dream.

<h1> Welcome </h1>


<p>I'm currently a Computer Science graduate student at Istanbul Technical University whose passion and research interests are directed towards image processing, computer vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Buea.</p>

<p>I am also a writer for some major publications including <a href = "https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence"> <b>Towards AI</b> </a> and <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/"> <b>Towards Datascience</b></a>  </p>

<p> I have always been fascinated by the idea of why humans act the way they do, so I spent most of free time reading interesting articles and books related to human psychology and self-development.</p>

<p> When I am not writing, I love hanging out with friends and visiting different historical touristic sites found in Turkey.</p>

As an African scholar, I was born with the natural rhythm of the African music. I listen, sing and dance whenever and wherever I feel the melody within.

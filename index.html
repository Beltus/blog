<h1> Meet Beltus Nkwawir </h1>

<p>I'm currently a Computer Science graduate student at Istanbul Technical University whose passion and research interests are directed towards image processing, computer vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.</p>
<p>I hold a bachelors degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Buea.</p>


I am fascinated by the concept of why humans act the way they do, so I spent most of free time reading interesting articles and books related to human psychology and self-development. I love hanging out with friends and visiting different historical touristic sites found in Turkey. As an African, I was naturally born with the rhythm of African music for which it has become my best buddy and safe haven in moments of solitude.

<h2> What Do I Write About On This site?</h2>
My primary objective for creating this site is to have a platform where I could freely share my ideas, experiences and knowledge to hundreds and if not thousands of passionate youths out there that are self-driven and willing to fight for their dreams.

<ul>
  <li>For those that are interested in getting a feel of what Data science is all about, I constantly post articles related to this.</li>
  <li>For those of you interested in working on real-life computer vision, machine learning and deep learning applications, I constantly post projects in the format of tutorials with codes and some theoretical background knowledge.</li>
  <li> As a scholar in one of Turkey's most prestigious universities, I write articles related to scholarships to help my readers gain a quick understanding of some insights of the scholarship process.</li>
  <li> Last but not least, I share articles regarding generally life experiences.</li>
</ul>

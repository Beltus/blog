<h1><center>Welcome to my blog</center> </h1>

<img src="https://beltus.github.io/vision/assets/images/beltus.jpg" alt="Picture of Beltus Nkwawir">
<p></p>


<p>My name is <b>Beltus Nkwawir</b> is a Computer Science Postgraduate scholar at Istanbul Technical University in Turkey
whose passion and research interests are directed towards the field of Artificial Intelligence specifically Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Buea in Cameroon.</p>

<p>As an uprising young African writer that draws inspiration from the challenges I've overcomed, I write to inspire and motivate
youths not only in Africa but across the globe.</p>

<p>Currently I am a writer for some major publications including <a href = "https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence"> <b>Towards AI</b> </a> and <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/"> <b>Towards Datascience</b></a>  </p>

<p>I am fascinated by the human mind and spend most of my time reading articles and books that will get me one step closer to figuring out this mystery</p>

<p>I enjoy listen and dancing to motherland African songs. </p>
<p> When I am not writing, I love hanging out with friends and visiting different historical touristic sites found in Turkey.</p>

# Forget about Motivation. Here is what you need...

Have you ever finished watching a motivational video and that very moment you feel like you can pull a Range Rover with one finger? 

Or you wake up one morning so pumped up with energy that you decide to engage in that 10 million dollar idea, but five minutes later, you find yourself miserably staring at some random youtube video about how to live in the Sahara desert for one month with no water. 

I'm guessing you are smiling right now because you know pretty well what I'm talking about. In fact, I have done it countless times in the past.

It became so normal that whenever I feel motivated I just tell myself it's going to pass anytime soon. So why even bother to start working on a project when you just going to abandon it in a few minutes or days?

It is pretty clear that motivation is super important to get us started, but it fails every time to get us across to the finish line. 

The problem is that, as humans, we tend to give a blind eye to simple truths that are right in front of us and we keep believing things will be different the next time. But it never is.

Let me explain. I have always believed for many years that motivation is what I needed to get the results I wanted. But why does that inner burning desire always die out every time? 

I asked myself this question time and time again and finally, I stumbled upon a tiny concept while reading the book **The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod.** I then immediately knew that I might have just found the key to solving this life-long mystery.

Before writing this article, I had to make sure this concept works. I have experimented on it for a month now and the results are mindblowing.

So in this article, I will show you how to not rely on motivation to finish whatever project you decide to work on. For example, writing a book, learning how to build a website, starting a new business, whatever it is.

Before you continue reading this article, I want you to put this in mind. **Motivation is going to give you the initial momentum** that you might need to get started, but it is not what you are going need to get to the finish line.

> What is going to get me to the finish line then?

The answer is simple. It is **Accountability** and I am going to show you how shortly in this article. 

Hal in his book suggested to his readers to each get what he calls an **accountability partner** to practice the lessons of the miracle morning with. It can be a friend, colleague, or even your dog if you are leaving on an isolated island in outer space(just kidding!)

When I saw that, I had a **vivid epiphany**. I asked myself what if I could apply the accountability technique to help solve my chronic procrastination problem. Yes, I do procrastinate a lot. Don't be shocked.

At that instant, I picked up my phone and posted these words on my WhatsApp status...

> "I have decided to create a book reading club to help those who like reading books to develop the discipline to complete the book they chose to read. Feel free to join using the link below",

Remember, this was me trying to get myself to read more books.

For those who were bold enough to join, I warmly welcomed them and set the following rule. 

1.  Choose a book you love to read.
2.  Calculate the number of chapters or pages in the book
3.  State the number of chapters or pages you will be reading daily
4.  State the date you going to begin reading
5.  Calculate the end date of completing the book
6.  Post it in the group.

These rules were meant to reinforce the concept of accountability. I knew that, by stating your name and posting the above information for everyone to see, you become obligated to do it. It's like making a deal or signing a contract. No one wants to be a fraud or liar or pretender or anything bad. 

Now, fast forward 3 weeks later. I completed a 500-page book in 8 days and I have just finished reading my second book **The Four-Hour Work Week** by Tim Ferris this morning before completing this article.

My book reading club members especially those who started the same day with me, are almost done reading their second books as well as I write this article today.

Remember that, these are normal guys and gals that could not even commit to reading 5 pages of a book a day, now some of them even surprised me by reading up to 60 pages some days. It is simply unbelievable.

> Do you see where I am going with this?

If not, let me explain. I decided not to look for an **accountability partner**. Instead, I looked for **an accountability group**. And then made everyone accountable to everyone.

Now, as the group creator, I have no choice but **to read at least a chapter of a book every day**. You can't preach what you don't practice. Can you?

Now, do I need motivation for that? You tell me. Whether I like it or not, whether I feel like it or not, I am bound to do it. I gave myself no way out. It is like creating your own prison, getting in, and then throwing the keys out of the window.

I know you might be thinking that this must be hard and I feel miserable and sad. Guess what? It is the best decision I ever made in my more than 2 decades of existence on mother earth and I go to bed happier than I ever did before. 

Words can't even begin to describe the feeling of being able to read at least 2 books every month while at the same time pushing people to become the best versions of themselves.

It is the most impactful transformation I ever witnessed in my life to date just within a short period of time all thanks to this new concept of accountability.

> Do you want to get stuff done?

Screw motivation. Here is what you need to do.

You need to put yourself in a situation where you are accountable to someone or a group of people. For this to be highly effective, it needs to feel like something you can only escape from when it is done. No other way out.

> But how can I get an accountability partner?

Getting an accountability partner is super easy. I don't even want you to do that. I want you to get an **accountability group.** Look it easy to call your accountability partner and convince him/her that, you need a two weeks break and he/she will definitely understand.

But convincing a group of people that truly depend on you is way more challenging and that is what I want you to do. If you are dead serious about completing any project, get a freaking accountability group, and see the magic.

Let's say for example you have decided to **learn how to create websites.** You had tried several times but you always gave up. Here is how you can hack your mind and get it done in less time than you ever thought possible.

Find a small organization in your locality. Explain to them how the world has become a global village and organizations like their all have websites. Make them see the importance of a website and then offer to create one for them for **FREE!!. No charge. Nadar. Sifir.**

Next, give them a deadline of 2 weeks or a maximum of a month. Set a specific date and time. Let them know you are going to update them weekly, then get to work.

Now, that is an inescapable prison. You won't need motivation to get it done. You just got yourself an accountability group. Your reputation hangs on the line. You either swim or drown in your own pool?

Fortunately, the innate human instinct is to survive and that's exactly what you're going to do. 

You can use this strategy on anything you plan on starting and finishing. You can even get creative. The higher the stakes the better. For example, you can make a deal of 1000 dollars or more with a friend, that if you don't finish reading a book in 1 week, it's all his.

Guess what? In two days you might even be done.

### The Takeaway

Whenever you feel demotivated about something you started to do with so much passion and enthusiasm. Remember, motivation is not necessarily what you need to get it done. 

You need an external driving force that will continuously push you even when you feel like stopping. I want you to understand that almost everyone gets demotivated after they start doing something and that is totally normal and you should expect it to happen.

The concept of accountability that I shared with you in this article is a powerful preemptive technique that is going to ensure that you get through the stormy days of your awesome project and to the very end.

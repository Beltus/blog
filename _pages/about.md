# Hello Everyone - Meet Beltus Nkwawir

I'm currently a Computer Science postgraduate student at Istanbul Technical University whose passion and research interests are directed towards image processing, computer vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

I hold a bachelors degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Buea.

I am a writer and I currently write for some major publications such as [Towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and [Towards AI](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence)/ Here is a link to one of my published article on [Supervised and Unsupervised Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-for-everyone-526f9b746dd5) on medium.

Most of the projects I have implemented up to date are mostly based on computer vision and machine learning, however, in the couples of weeks to come, I will include deep learning projects.

I have worked on Vehicle Detection, Facial Recognition, Eye detection, Face and eye tracking application, plant classification, tactile pavement detection projects for the visually impaired among others. Here is a link to my [github page](https://github.com/Beltus).


I have always been fascinated by the idea of why humans act the way they do, so I spent most of free time reading interesting articles and books related to human psychology and self-development.

I love hanging out with friends and visiting different historical touristic sites found in Turkey. As an African scholar, I was born with the natural rhythm of the African music. I listen, sing and dance whenever and wherever I feel the melody within.

# Hello Everyone - Meet Beltus Nkwawir

I'm currently a Computer Science graduate student at Istanbul Technical University whose passion and research interests are directed towards image processing, computer vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I hold a bachelors degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Buea.

I am an aspiring writer and I currently write for some major publications such as [Towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/). Here is a link to one of my published article on [Supervised and Unsupervised Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-for-everyone-526f9b746dd5) on medium.

Most of the projects I have implemented up to date are mostly based on computer vision and machine learning, however, in the couples of weeks to come, I will include deep learning projects. I have worked on Vehicle Detection, Facial Recognition, Eye detection, Face and eye tracking application, plant classification, tactile pavement detection projects for the visually impaired among others. Here is a link to my [github page](https://github.com/Beltus).


I am fascinated by the concept of why humans act the way they do, so I spent most of free time reading interesting articles and books related to human psychology and self-development. I love hanging out with friends and visiting different historical touristic sites found in Turkey. As an African, I was naturally born with the rhythm of music.so in solitude, music becomes my best buddy



# What Do I Write About On This site?
My primary objective for creating this site is to have a platform where I could freely share my ideas, experiences and knowledge to hundreds and if not thousands of passionate youths out there that are self-driven and willing fight for their dreams.

* For those that are interested in getting a feel of what Data science is all about, I constantly post articles related to this.
* For those of you interested in working on real-life computer vision, machine learning and deep learning applications, I constantly post projects in the format of tutorials with codes and some theoretical background knowledge.
- As a scholar in one of Turkey's most prestigious universities, I write articles related to scholarships to help my readers gain a quick understanding of some insights of the daunting scholarship process.
* Last but least, I share articles regarding generally life experiences
